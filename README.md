# Who is this demo for?

This demo is for everyone who wants to get insights in how to create a simple Neural Network in Visual Basic.

# How to Start the Demo?

Open Project1.vbp in Visual Basic and Start the Demo Program.

# Background

This demonstrates one of the simplest use case of a Neural Network. And the Demo App shows, how Neural Networks and AI works in general.

The Demo App here decides, wether specific apartements in the greater area of Zurich are a good or a bad deal.

The Neural Network uses for it's decision the two parameters "Price" and "m2".

Note: The worthiness of the deal, actually could be calculated with math.

But instead of Calculating the worthiness of the deal with math, we use a Neural Network to decide if a deal is good or bad.

This Demo is to teach students in the deeper understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

After teaching the Neural Network some thousands of calculated training records with the help of Backpropagation, the decisions of the Neural Network become very accurate.
